# Smart Farm Project

## Overview

This project is a culmination of a four-month internship at the Bu-Crocs laboratory at Bangkok University. It is divided into two main parts aimed at enhancing agricultural practices through technology.

### Part 1: Smart Unit

In the first phase, I am developing a smart unit that measures various environmental parameters, including temperature, humidity, nutrients, and light levels. The data collected from these measurements will be stored on a Raspberry Pi. Additionally, I am creating an application that allows users to visualize this data in real-time through graphs. The application will also include a crop recommendation system, helping farmers make informed decisions based on the environmental conditions.

### Part 2: NPK Optical Sensor

The second phase involves the development of an optical sensor for measuring nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels in the soil. This sensor will utilize RGB LEDs and a photodiode to measure the amount of light transmitted through the soil. By analyzing the light transmission, we can derive important information regarding the nutrient content of the soil, providing valuable insights for crop management.
